    <h2>Desciption</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of wide, flat pasta sheets layered
      with various ingredients, typically including a rich meat or vegetable
      sauce, ricotta or b√©chamel cheese, and mozzarella. The layers are baked in
      the oven until bubbly and golden. The most common version is made with
      ground beef, tomatoes, and spices, but variations can include other
      proteins, such as chicken or sausage, or be made vegetarian with spinach,
      mushrooms, and other vegetables. Lasagna is known for its hearty,
      comforting qualities.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound ground pork</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>2 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
      <li>2 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>

      <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley, divided</li>

      <li>2 clove garlic, crushed</li>

      <li>tablespoons dried basil</li>

      <li>1 tablespoons salt</li>

      <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>STEPS</h4>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high
        heat; cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. Add onion
        and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley,
        garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. Reduce heat to medium-low and
        simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water
        to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring
        occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain
        and set aside.
      </li>

      <li>
        Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a
        9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. Place two layers of noodles
        over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of
        the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layers
        once more using the remaining noodles, cheese mixture, sauce, and
        mozzarella. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes. Remove the foil and
        bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.
